# IMSDb Movie Script Parser
A python parser for movie scripts.
This project was conducted during the class "Object Oriented Programming in Python", given by Davide Picca and assisted by Coline MÃ©trailler during the spring semester 2020 at the University of Lausanne (UNIL).

We used a database of 1119 english-speaking movie scripts in plain text format (.txt), retrieved from the [Internet Movie Script Database](https://www.imsdb.com/). 

The parsed JSON files generated by the code can be found in the `parsed_scripts` folder of this repository.

# Dependencies
- Python 3
- [dataclasses_json](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses-json/)

# Usage
Create an instance of the `ScriptParser` class. Call the `parse()` method with a string corresponding to an entire movie script. It outputs a `Movie` instance.

```python
from ScriptParser import ScriptParser

parser = ScriptParser()

parsed_movie = parser.parse(my_movie_string)
```

The full pipeline that we used to generate the JSON files using the parser can be found in the `main.py` script.

# Data
The parser returns data that is structured as follows. They can be converted into JSON format using the `to_json()` method, thanks to the `dataclasses_json` library.

## Movie
This class represents a parsed movie. It regroups metadata, and a list of all the characters speaking in the script.

| Attribute     | type              | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------------| ------------ |
| `Title`         | `str`             | the title of the movie |
| `Author`        | `list(str)`       | a list of the script's writers |
| `Genre`         | `list(str)`       | a list of the movie's genres |
| `Characters`    | `list(Character)` | a list of the characters speaking in this movie

## Character
This class represents one of the movie's characters. It is contained in a `Movie`'s `Characters` list.

A `get_replies()` method allows access to the list of replies.

| Attribute     | type              | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------------| ------------ |
| `Character`     | `str`             | the name of the character |
| `Replies`       | `list(Reply)`     | a list of the character's replies in the script |

## Reply
This class represents one reply spoken by a character. It is contained in a `Character`'s `Replies` list.

A `get_start()` and a `get_end()` method allows access to the corresponding attribute value.

| Attribute  | type  | Description  |
| ---------- |-------| ------------ |
| `Reply`      | `str` | the text of this reply |
| `Didascalie` | `str` | the text of the didascalie. If there is no didascalie, the default value is an empty string. |
| `Start`      | `int` | start position in number of characters from the start of the script |
| `End`        | `int` | end position in number of characters from the start of the script |

# Parameters
You can overwrite or change certain attributes of a `ScriptParser`, depending on your needs.
| Attribute           | type  | Description  |
| ------------------- |-------| ------------ |
| `minimum_replies`     | `int` | The minimal amount of replies under which a character is rejected. The default value is 1. This discards all characters with no replies. With the value adjusted to 2, most false-positives will be eliminated, but also some minor characters with it. |
| `character_blacklist` | `list(str)` | A list of strings. If any of the strings in the list is contained in a character name, the character will be rejected. |
| `reply_blacklist`     | `list(str)` | A list of strings used to filter replies. If any of the strings are found in the reply (case sensitive), the reply will be rejected |

`character_blacklist` and `reply_blacklist` already contain some black listed words (e.g. `INT.` or `NIGHT`). You can completely overwrite the list, or append additional words:

```python
parser = ScriptParser()

# add words to the blacklist
parser.character_blacklist += ["NEW", "WORDS"]

# overwrite the blacklist
parser.character_blacklist = ["ENTIRELY", "NEW", "WORDS"]
```
